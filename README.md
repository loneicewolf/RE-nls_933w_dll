This repository is dedicated to the theoretical research and analysis of the NLS Rootkit, also known as NLS_933W.DLL. <b>For safety reasons, the actual malware samples are not included here.</b> They can be found in my other repository focused on NLS_933_DLL. Additionally, for related research, you might want to check my Stuxnet repository.

## Introduction

NLS_933W.DLL is a malware that targets storage device firmware, specifically HDD/SSD firmware, making it a boot/rootkit. **In a nutshell, that's NLS_933W.DLL**.

### Purpose

This repository is a collection of NLS_933W.DLL-related files gathered from various sources to make it more accessible for researchers and antivirus developers. The repository includes:
- **Binary/Raw files**
- **Memory and Hardware Dumps (`JTAG`/`UART`)**
- **Sample Firmwares (before and after with diff)**

### Important Warnings

‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is for research and educational purposes only! Even if you run these in a Virtual Machine, USE CAUTION.‚ö†Ô∏è Samples and reports are sourced from various contributors to provide a comprehensive collection.

### Why This Repository?

NLS_933W.DLL is nearly impossible to find on the internet. I discovered it on one of my hard drives as part of a sample collection. This repository aims to consolidate information and resources related to this elusive malware.

## Malware Samples

For the actual malware, please visit the [**only_malware**] branch in the other NLS933W.DLL repository.

- If you see `need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)`, you need to install `engrampa` on Linux. I use Qubes for malware and Engrampa to pack infected archives.
