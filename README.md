# RE-nls_933w_dll
The REsearch(no pun intended on the `RE`) about the NLS Root(or `boot`)kit.
The malware itself can be found on my other repo about nls_933_dll, not including it here , for safety reasons. I will only talk generally and perform theoretical research(using code where applicable) in this repo. Check the other Stuxnet repo as well, as I will take the README from that repo, and modify it as I want the research in this topic to be WELL WRITEN for once!
