This repository is dedicated to the theoretical research and analysis of the NLS Rootkit, also known as NLS_933W.DLL. For safety reasons, the actual malware samples are not included here. They can be found in my other repository focused on NLS_933_DLL. Additionally, for related research, you might want to check my Stuxnet repository.

## Malware Samples

For the actual malware, please visit the [**only_malware**] branch in the other NLS933W.DLL repository.

- If you see `need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)`, you need to install `engrampa` on Linux. I use Qubes for malware and Engrampa to pack infected archives.
